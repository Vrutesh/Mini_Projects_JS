# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Mini Projects repository! This collection features several small projects aimed at practicing JavaScript fundamentals. Below is a brief overview of each project included:

## 1. Stepper

The Stepper project is a simple application that allows users to increment or decrement a number using buttons. It's a great exercise for understanding event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## 2. Resume Generator

The Resume Generator project enables users to create basic resumes by filling out a form with their personal information. This project focuses on form validation and dynamically generating HTML content based on user input.

## 3. Calculator

The Calculator project is a basic calculator application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It demonstrates the use of functions and conditional statements in JavaScript.

## 4. Tic Tac Toe

The Tic Tac Toe project is a classic game implemented using JavaScript. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to form a line of three of their symbols. This project emphasizes logic and algorithm implementation.

Feel free to explore each project's directory for more details and dive into the code to understand how they were implemented.
